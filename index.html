<p>Welcome to my reference document for various Stardew Valley Mods! 
  I like running many mods at once, and it's always a pain to try to flip through several wikis. 
  This was inspried by Mouseypound's PPJA reference index. 
  I looked at their coding, and wasn't really sure how to manage the automatic extraction bit, so I've just put everything in by hand. 
  On that note, do leet me know if you notice any mistakes. 
  I'll do my best to minimize mistakes, but it does happen. </p> 
<p>All the mods that are included are listed below! 
  If you have a specific mod you want included, let me know and I'll do my best! </p>
